			<h1>Design Process</h1>
			<br>
			<p>The alternative to our idea is a wireless connection between two brains. The idea consists of electrodes recording their signals and some form of radio signals to transmit the information. The idea does not work. With the limited research, the brains must be wired together, in order to be connected.</p><br>
			<p>Another alternative to our idea is integrating 5G wireless connection in the process of data transmission between the subject and the computer. It would run way faster than a 4G connection. This is not possible, due to the fact that 5G internet requires a lot of energy. Furthermore, due to the Information Transfer Rate, signals are subject to errors due to misinterpretations by BCIs, and databases and clouds that maintain the information can ultimately fail in transmitting accurate information from one brain to another or from a brain to a BCI (Abdulkader et al., 2015). </p><br>
			<p>The last alternative for BCI is magnetoencephalography (MEG) to collect brain signals to be uploaded to a BCI which records the brain’s electrical signals using the magnetic field created (Abdulkader et al., 2015). This alternative is non-invasive and is generally more reliable since the signals collected are not as distorted by the skull layer compared to other methods such as EEGs (Abdulkader et al., 2015). However, this alternative was scrapped since the MEG interferes with the earth’s magnetic signal.</p>
