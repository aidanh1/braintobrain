			<h1>History</h1>
			<br>
			<p>The big discoverty with brain mapping occured with Hans Berger's work with the human brain. Moreover, the creation of electroencephalography can be credited to Berger (“History of Brain Computer Interfaces,” 2014). </p><br><p>Another huge year for brain mapping was 1988. This is where Philip Kennedy implanted the first brain computer implanted object into a human(“History of Brain Computer Interfaces”). The only positive outcome of the implant was the use of a wireless di-electrode.</p><br>
			<p>During 2001, John Donoghue and his team had a goal of designing a brain computer interface on commercial scale or known as "BrainGate". The official product was known as NeuroPort. NeuroPort was able to detect "micro seizure activity" right before a seizure occured (“History of Brain Computer Interfaces,” 2014).</p><br>
			<p>Later in 2004, during June, the first BCI was implanted into a human. Later in december, a human was able to control a computer using a brain-computer interface (“History of Brain Computer Interfaces,” 2014).</p><br>
			<p>More recently in 2013, Pais-Viera et al. (2013) conducted an experiement with rats. The rats were using brain to brain interface. One rat would be in a dark maze. The other rat would see the whole maze. The rats communicated using brain to brain interface. The rats success rate was 78.87% success rate (Pais-Vieira et al., 2013).</p>
